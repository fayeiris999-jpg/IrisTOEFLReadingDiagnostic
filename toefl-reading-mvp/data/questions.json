  "passage": [
    "The Mycenaean Greek civilization, which featured cities and a thriving economy, dominated the Aegean and parts of the Mediterranean beginning about 1600 B.C.E. But around 1100 B.C.E., Greek society entered a period of decline known as the Dark Ages that lasted for roughly three centuries. A new Greek culture emerged in the eighth century B.C.E.--the conventional start date is 776 B.C.E.--marking the beginning of the Archaic Age, which brought a revival of Greek trade and culture as the Greeks again became one of the major economic and political forces in the Mediterranean world, This happened for several reasons. For one thing, the Dark Ages had seen a constant population increase, and Greece, with its great expanses of rocky and hilly soil, simply could not grow enough agricultural staples to support a large population. Methods for dealing with the extra mouths were needed.",
    "One response was to import food. As a consequence, Greek trade and manufacturing expanded. In exchange for olive oil, fine pottery, silver, and slaves, the Greeks acquired grain in Egypt and in the lands on the Black Sea coast. The expansion of Greek commerce brought the Greeks into conflict with the current Mediterranean trading power, the Phoenicians. The large, 30-oared Greek warships, known as triakonters, of the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.E. were replaced by fleets of iron-beaked ships known as pentakonters, which were 90 feet long and had 50 oars. The clumsy, two-decked Phoenician warships were no match for the more maneuverable Greek ships and the Greeks soon wrested control of much of Mediterranean trade from their Phoenician competitors, who at this time also were under attack by the Assyrians.",
    "The revival of Greek trade also had other consequences. The Greeks brought back culture as well as grain, and as a result Greek culture evolved based largely on borrowings from the much more ancient and sophisticated cultures of the Near East. From the Phoenicians they borrowed the alphabet, for they now had just as great a need to keep records. In order to adapt the Phoenician alphabet, which had been designed to write Semitic languages, to write their own language, the Greeks added new letters representing vowels to make it more clear which word was meant.",
    "In the late seventh century B.C.E. the Greeks of Ionia adopted coinage from the Lydians who lived in Turkey. In the early sixth century, coinage spread to the mainland, with the island city of Aegina issuing staters (coins of a standard weight) bearing a turtle on one side and a simple punch mark on the other. Around 570 B.C.E., Corinth issued coins bearing an image of Pegasus, the winged horse thought to have alighted at Corinth to drink from a sacred well, and about 525 B.C.E. Athens began issuing its famous Owls which bore the head of the goddess Athena on one side and Athena's owl on the other. A multitude of other Greek cities also issued coins as a means of asserting their status and independence. The coins of important trading cities such as Aegina, Corinth, and Athens became standard currency in the Mediterranean world because of their extensive circulation. One problem, however, was that the Greeks could not agree on standard weights for all their coins, and since trading cities attempted to carve out their own spheres of economic influence by favoring the use of coins with their own weights, this resulted in a complicated mathematical calculation if, say, someone wanted to use Corinthian coins to pay for something with a price expressed in Athenian coins.",
    "The Greeks also assimilated ideas about artistic expression from the East. During the Dark Ages, artistic designs had consisted of simple geometric patterns. The Archaic Age introduced a multitude of Eastern styles. Greek sculpture assumed a very Egyptian look, and, in the orientalizing style, at its height around 750 B.C.E., Greek pottery depicted many Eastern motifs such as lions, bulls, and sphinxes. But Greek artists soon developed their own idiosyncratic style by incorporating into their designs' scenes drawn from their own myths and legends. Greek potters competed with each other to perfect different manufacturing techniques and artistic styles, and they soon were the acknowledged masters of pottery making in the Mediterranean."
