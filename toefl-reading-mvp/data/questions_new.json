  "title": "The Origin of the K-T Asteroid",
  "passage": [
    "It is now generally accepted that dinosaurs (and large numbers of other animals and plants) went extinct about 65 million years ago, when Earth was hit by a giant asteroid (a rocky, planet-like celestial body). This extinction episode is called the K-T extinction, since it marks the boundary between the Cretaceous (spelled with a \"K\" in German) and Tertiary geologic periods. Remarkably, researchers now believe they have traced the object that caused the k-T catastrophe back to its source. If they are right, a collision in the asteroid belt nearly 100 million years before the K-T impact sealed the fate of the dinosaurs. The asteroid belt, which lies between Mars and Jupiter, is filled with millions of small and large asteroids orbiting the Sun (the largest, Ceres, is almost 600 miles across), and astronomers have recognized for some time that the belt is the major source of Earth's meteorites (asteroids or parts of asteroids that have survived the fall to Earths surface). Occasional collisions, and gravitational perturbations of asteroid orbits by other solar system bodies, can send these objects hurling toward Earth. Close similarities in mineralogical composition between asteroids and various meteorite groups confirm their connection. The similarities are deduced using a method of spectral analysis called \"reflectance spectroscopy,\" which involves analysis of the light reflected from an object. Because minerals absorb light of specific, characteristic wavelengths and reflect the rest, the peaks and valleys in the spectrum of light reflected from an asteroid serve as fingerprints for the minerals present on its surface.",
    "In the asteroid belt, the largest rocky survivor of the collision thought to be the precursor to the K-T impact is known to astronomers as the asteroid Baptistina, which was discovered in 1890 by the French astronomer Auguste Charlos. Baptistina is about 26 miles across, but it was once much larger, since it is, so to speak, the matriarch of an extended asteroid family, a large group of fragments all traveling together in roughly the same orbital path and, as far as can be determined from spectral analyses, all with a similar mineral makeup.",
    "What is the evidence that connects the Baptistina family of asteroids to the K-T impact? It is, admittedly, circumstantial, but it is compelling. The idea was proposed in a 2007 report by a group of astronomers who used computer simulations to examine how the Baptistina asteroid family (BAF for short) had evolved over time. They began by carefully mapping out the exact locations and sizes of all known objects in the family, and then working backward, calculated how their positions have changed through time due to the gravitational pull of other bodies including other asteroids, the Sun, and the planets. They found that the BAFs present-day configuration is best explained by the breakup of a single large object (at least 100 miles across) during an asteroid belt collision about 160 million years ago.",
    "The calculations also showed that many fragments from the collision would have escaped the asteroid belt altogether, and some would have ended up in the vicinity of Earth. The researchers concluded that our planet must have experienced an increase in asteroid impacts for a period of about 100 million years after the collision. In fact, studies of the number and rate at which impact craters formed on the Moon and Earth had already shown this. The K-T collision took place during this period. While this does not prove that the impactor came from the Baptistina family, there is also another piece of corroborating evidence that bolsters the argument.",
    "Spectral analysis of BAF asteroids indicates that they are composed of an uncommon type of extraterrestrial material that is especially rich in carbon: meteorites matching this composition are relatively rare in the worlds collections. However, sediments deposited at the K-T boundary contain a unique chemical marker that is specific to this carbon-rich meteorite family. Thus both the timing and composition fit. The conclusion that an asteroid \"shower\" generated by the breakup of Baptistina was the source of the K-T impactor seems highly likely; the astronomers who did the work estimated the probability at greater than 90 percent. They also concluded that around 20 percent of the large asteroids that are currently in the vicinity of Earth originate from the BAF."
